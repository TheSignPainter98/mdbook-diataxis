# mdbook-diataxis

A preprocessor for [mdBook][mdbook] which helps apply the [di치taxis][diataxis] documentation framework.

## Installation

Type and run

```bash
cargo install mdbook-diataxis
```

This will build `mdbook-diataxis` from source.

## Integrating `mdbook-diataxis`

Type and run the following command with the path to your book.

```bash
mdbook-diataxis install path/to/book
```

You will see that a new `[preprocessor.diataxis]` table has been added to your `book.toml`, the `[output.html]` table has been amended to include the newly-written `diataxis.css` file.

The di치taxis directives are now available for use!

## Usage

### `{{#diataxis compass}}`

Expands to an `html` representation of of the di치taxis compass.

The text of each part of the compass can be [configured via `book.toml`](#configuration).

### `{{#diataxis table-of-contents}}`
